## Authentication and Authorization

## ðŸ’¡ Purpose

This is a complementary discussion of [BACKEND](https://github.com/gsaaraujo/authentication-and-authorization-backend). This frontend was also developed using Clean Architecture. 
You might wonder, is it worth it? Applying Clean Architecture in Frontend? In my opinion it does. Since your business rules will be (and it should be) in your backend then it'll be even easier to use Clean Architecture.


## ðŸ’» Project

This project is the front end of [BACKEND](https://github.com/gsaaraujo/authentication-and-authorization-backend).
You can access the layout in [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/QnNHfVjGgIHskldKThYPX6/authentication_authorization?node-id=0%3A1).
